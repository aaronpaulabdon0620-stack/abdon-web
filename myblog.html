MY EXPERIENCE AS A FRESHMAN  
<p></p> My experience as a 1st year college student. I must say being a freshman is really hard, because we still adjusting about our new campus and also in our subject and schedule.In my first month as a college student i still adjusting because the subject are very different from the high school. And also as i enter a college i also have a new classmate that im gonna be with for the rest of the semester.</p>
